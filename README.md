## CLU CodeFlower

A project to visualize the CLU Lab repositories (https://github.com/clulab) in an
interactive tree using the [CodeFlower project](http://fzaninotto.github.com/CodeFlower).

Each colored disc represents a file, with a radius proportional to the number of lines of code
(LOC). All rendering is done client-side, in JavaScript.
